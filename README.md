# GitHub API Gist Browser

The objective of this project is to:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Interact with GitHub's API in order to search for a user's gists  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Search for a user's gists  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-See the filetypes available in that gist  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-See the contents of a user's gist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-See the last users that forked that gist  

## How the app works

The application is designed in an extremely simple way.  
The user enters a GitHub username in the input field then clicks on the Submit button.  
After doing so, up to 30 of the username's gists are being shown.  
If the user wants to see more gists, he can click on "Load more" to do so
If the user wants to see contents of a gist he can click on a gist to see all the files in that gist and their content
